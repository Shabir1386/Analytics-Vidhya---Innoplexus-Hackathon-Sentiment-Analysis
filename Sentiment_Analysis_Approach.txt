Approach on building ML model to predict Sentiments:

Steps Involved:

1. Import the relevant libraries
2. Import the train dataset from train file
3. Pre-process the data in the dataset loaded from the file
4. Import sklearn related libraries
5. Clean-up the contents of the column "text"in the file
6. Inspect the Cleaned dataset and change the case for the column "text"
7. Import "CountVectorizer" to extract the Features and to Fit, Transform the DataFrame created so far
8. Build the model using "LogisticRegression" and fitting the X_train, y_train data created using "train_test_split"
9. Accuracy for different C values are achieved by this step and final model is built on
10.Final model is built using appropriate C value and Final Accuracy is achieved
11.Sentiments are predicted using splitted data of (X_test) with the Final model
12.Inspect the weights for each of the tokens from the column "text" in the file
13.Test the Final model built using the test file
14.Predict the Sentiments for the dataset in the test file
15.Concatenate unique_hash_df, sentiment columns data in DataFrame
16.Export the data into a .csv file

Outcome:
innoplexus_sentiment_contest.csv file gets created in the "Home" dir of Jupyter Notebook
